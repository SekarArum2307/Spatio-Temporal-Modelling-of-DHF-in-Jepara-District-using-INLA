# Spatio-Temporal-Modelling-of-DHF-in-Jepara-District-using-INLA
DHF analysis based on spatio-temporal modelling approach using INLA in R programming. This repository include some of the codes that have been used in the analysis and other relevant sources and materials. The aim of the analysis is to get better understanding in distribution pattern of the disease based on village administration as the spatial unit. The output of this research consist of standardized incidence ratio (SIR) maps and relative risk maps in each month which were divided into two type of temporal time, wet season and dry season.
